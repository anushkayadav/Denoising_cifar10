# Implementation of Denoising Algorithms on CIFAR-10 Dataset

Applied Various Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms on ciar-10 data to denoise the images. 
Focused on Denoising auto-encoders which does unsupervised pre-training and can learn good representations via reconstruction

## Algorithms Used :  
1.  Simple Denoising Autoencoders (DAE)
2. Convolutional Auto-encoders with Symmetric Skip Connections
3. Feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs)
